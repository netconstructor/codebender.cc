<h1>{{site_name}} <small>so what&#39;s the deal?</small></h1>
<div class="marketing">
	<p>{{ site_name }} is a web platform for embedded software development, aimed at developers, artists, makers and hardware enthusiasts, and we think it is the next step to the maker revolution. It allows you to join the maker revolution and start building a cool hardware project, like an automated grill, a cat feeder, bike GPS or your very own weather station, by simplifying Arduino programming. We want to lower the barrier to entry, which is necessary to help everyday people start their first project, become makers and advance technology instead of using it. {{ site_name }} requires no installation, so you can get started with Arduino programming the minute you get one in your hands! And with the development tools we provide, you can do so faster and easier! {{ site_name }} also stores your code on the cloud, so it’s safe and accessible from anywhere, anytime. Here's a small list of features:</p>

	    <h2>Code</h2>
	    <p>{{ site_name }} uses Ace, an awesome web code editor written in pure HTML5 and Javascript, which is the best thing ever since sliced bread, at least as far as code editors go. Use it now and enjoy indentation that just works™, great syntax highlighting, auto-completion, highlighting of matching parentheses and brackets and highlighting of a selected keyword. Oh, and of course, you can't call it an editor if it doesn't have Vim and EMACS keybindings. Built-in.</p>

	    <h2>Compile</h2>
	    <p>Compile your code, on the cloud. With {{ site_name }}, you can compile your code on our servers, saving you the hassle of downloading and installing all the necessary tools to build your sketches. No more upgrading to newer versions and managing incompatible library versions. This also improves compilation times in old machines and simplifies syntax error checks.</p>

	    <h2>Built-in Libraries <small>coming soon</small></h2>
	    <p>Never mind about finding, installing, and updating external libraries anymore. With {{ site_name }}, you only need to include the library you want to use, and we automatically compile it with your code. And we also take care of updating them when a new version is released. All just for you. Stop worrying about libraries, and start coding your Arduino. That autonomous space BBQ laser grill isn't going to build itself, you know.</p>

	    <h2>Documentation and Suggestions</h2>
	    <p>{{site_name}} makes finding the documentation for that one function you are looking for as easy as it can get. Just select it, press Ctrl-Space, and you will be take to its arduino.cc Reference page. And it gets better. We are actively documenting Arduino's codebase, in order to provide a better reference, as well as suggestions and auto-completion in the near future.</p>
